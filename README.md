The proposed solution utilizes OpenCV and computer vision techniques to detect vehicles in real-time and accurately calculate their speeds. We begin by capturing live video streams from a camera, emphasizing smooth operation with minimal delay and maintaining high video quality. Central to our approach is the identification of moving vehicles through frame differencing, complemented by grayscale conversion for enhanced feature isolation. We further refine object localization using contouring and dilation techniques. Finally, we continuously track vehicles within a specified detection area to calculate their speeds precisely.
